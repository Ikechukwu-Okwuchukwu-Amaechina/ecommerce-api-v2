# ecommerce-api-v2

A lightweight Node.js API skeleton for an e-commerce backend. This repository is set up to evolve into a production-ready REST API.

## Features

- Clean starting point for a Node.js/Express e-commerce API
- Ready for environment-based configuration via .env
- Git-friendly defaults with a Node.js .gitignore
- Structured to add routes, models, and services incrementally

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js (LTS recommended) installed.
2. Clone the repository and install dependencies.

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/Ikechukwu-Okwuchukwu-Amaechina/ecommerce-api-v2.git
cd ecommerce-api-v2

# install
npm install
```

## Usage

The project currently has no start script defined. Typical next steps:

```bash
# create an entry point
echo "console.log('API bootstrapped');" > index.js

# run it
node index.js
```

Feel free to add common scripts in package.json such as:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root for secrets and configuration:

```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
```

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- npm

You can extend with Express, TypeScript, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Prisma/Sequelize, Jest, and Docker as needed.
